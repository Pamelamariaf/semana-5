        <h2>Lettering</h2><br>
       <p>It can be defined simply as "The art of drawing letters". It's very simple. It is a specific combination of letters <br>designed for a single use and purpose.<br> It can not be confused with "Typography" or "Calligraphy".<br></p>

        <h2>Tipography</h2><br>

       <p>It is the art and technique of handling and selecting fonts to create print jobs, therefore it deals with the subject<br> of letters, numbers and symbols of a printed text, a design, its shape, its size and visual relationships.</p>

       <h2>Caligraphy</h2><br>

       <p>It's a bit similar to lettering, but not in everything. It is more like the design and execution of lettering.<br> The easiest way to know the difference between lettering and calligraphy is that lettering are drawn letters and<br> calligraphy are written and require ornaments.<br><br>As long as you have free time, practice the letters that you like the most and you will see that they become a super<br> fun habit.The first letters or words never look good or "perfect", do not feel bad, keep trying new things. You have to<br> create with what you have in front of you and make this part of your daily habit</p>
